# Cardiac-Arrhythmia
Cardiac Arrhythmia refers to a medical condition in which heart beats irregularly.  
The electrocardiogram (ECG) plays an imperative role in the medical ﬁeld, as it records heart signal over time and is used 
to discover numerous cardiovascular diseases. 
If a documented ECG signal has a certain irregularity in its predeﬁned features, this is called arrhythmia,
the types of which include tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular arrhythmias, and ventricular, etc.
The dataset has been taken from kaggle and contains only 452 records and 280 features. We will try to identitfy from the given features
whether the person has Cardiac-Arrhythmia and if yes, then which type of Arrhythmia. 
This becomes a binary as well as multiclass classification probelm
